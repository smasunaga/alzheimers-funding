Progress:
-made repo
-started to clean data in Excel
-researched all the holes in the data I found

Where to go next:
-data ends in 2011 - need to get the data through at least 2012
	
-who are these agencies
	*why is NCI doing research funding?

-don't change your Excel data - work in R instead
-try to aggregate the "funding organizations" column so that there's not multiple copies
-look at the break-down of research funding by topic if total funding doesn't look good
-load the ENTIRE data set into R â€” it's okay if you have empty columns because you can delete them later.
